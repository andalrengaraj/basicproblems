If the dealer's face-up card is a ten card or ace ,they can look at their face-down cards to see, if the two cards makes a natural.

### PLAYER'S PLAY

* The player must decide between "**stand**" or "**hit**".

* Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt to them (stand)             
         
         
 * (**or**)
          

 * They may ask the dealer for additonal cards,one at a time(hit) until deciding to "stand" on the total or goes "**burst**".

* In the burst case,the player loses :confused:!!

### DEALER'S PLAY

* When the player stand ,the dealer face-down card is turned up.

* If the total is 16 or less,they must take a card.



* The dealer continue to take card until the total is 17 or more,at which point the dealer must stand.

* Whenever the burst condition occurs that dealer loses the match. :confused:
