 ~|ARRAY | LINKED LIST
--------|-------|------------
**Access**|Random Access  | Sequential access.
**Memory Space**|Array needs continuous memory space. |No need of continuous memory space.
**Size**|Array has fixed size | Variable Size
**Number of elements**|Fixed number of elements | Variable number of elements.
|**Memory overhead**|No memory overhead | Memory overhead occurs.
**Speed**|Faster in  accessing elements|Faster in add,remove elements.
**Memory assigment**|Memory assigned during compile time|Memory assigned during Runtime.
**Time Complexity**|**Access**-0(1) **Insert**-0(N) **Remove**-0(N)| **Access**-0(N).  If you have reference node to **Insert**-0(1) **Remove**-0(1)
**Space Complexity**| **Storage**-0(N)| **Storage**-0(2N)


### When to use?

### ARRAY:

* When user need a speed random access.

* If the user knows the size and number of elements is fixed.

 * It can be used in a Space constrainted environment.

### LINKEDLIST:

* When the user have memory spaces at different locations(not continuous).

* When the user aware of the memory overhead problem.

* When the size,number of elements are variable.

* When insertion and deletion are heavily used.
